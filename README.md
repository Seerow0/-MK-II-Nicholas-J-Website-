# Welcome to Nick's Github_pages for dummies.

[Website](https://seerow0.github.io/testing/)

We will be starting with the Portfolyou theme and breaking it down into a personal website(because to do so from scratch would require every free second of my free time which I use for fun activities and sleep). Along the way, I will add any helpful tips and references here to access it for my delightful self in the future. 

[Forked Theme](https://youssefraafatnasry.github.io/portfolYOU/docs/)

# Good references for comparing code to see what I can do like other people who forked the repository and made made creative changes.

# First and foremost, 
the config.yml file is important for melding your website together. An important note is for baseurl:, you are going to want to add the name of the repository like the example shown below. Otherwise, the website will not work. In this case, my repository is named "testing". (for now)

baseurl: "/testing" 

There are other customizable features on the config such as the description which changes the text that appears on the landing page below the image. There is also the matter of adding an image. In order to add an image, a simple way would be to add a folder in your repository for images. In my case I have two seperate folders, one for images and one for gifs. Then when you navigate to the folder and open the image in a new tab, you will obtain the raw link which will look something like this.  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seerow0/testing/main/gifs/nic.gif
You will add this link to the config.yml where it says images and the image should appear on the website.

You should be able to drag and drop as well which I find is better for video content and it is more convenient to host the images in your repository folder. 

# Adding Images to MD files (Markdown)

# Changing the Logo that appears on the tab section of your website
This file is located in the assets folder like so: assets/favicon.ico
the favicon is a small feature but also a form of your websites identity. Whenever an individual bookmarks your website, the logo will the first thing they see, it should be familiar and easy to read. For example the youtube logo and the google logo are easy to recognize and click when looking among several bookmarked tabs. 
To replace the logo, simply attatch a new file and delete the old "favicon.ico" 
A good reference to obtain your own favlogo or even convert an existing graphic is to generate your own using [favicon](https://favicon.io/) or any other tool.
1. Copy your new `favicon.ico` file into your own project with the same file path **`assets/favicon.ico`**.

# Changing the emoji on the light mode and dark mode toggle button.

Navigate to **theme.scss** 
Line: "@include themed(content, "ðŸŒ™", "ðŸŒž");"
Alternativley, you can search through the index on the top right and look for the current emoji featured on the website location. Honestly, if you spot the emojis, your in the right place unless your some mad lad with a knack for adding emojis all over your code, then you'd be looking for **@include themed(content, "[Emoji]", "[Emoji]");**

#To use gifs, get the raw link by copying the image address raw link on the image and pasting it in browser, then copying the link you get on landing page. Should look like above
