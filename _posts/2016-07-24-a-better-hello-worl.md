I Buy 3D Printer. I print from 3d printer. I paint 3d models. Such is the life of a hobbyist.

I like to print variety of things. 

Anyways, here is what I have done, What I am in the process of doing, and what I have plans for.

## 1. Intro

For me, diving into the realms of 3D printing and painting isn't just a hobby—it's a deeply fulfilling journey that infuses my creative process with boundless energy and inspiration. As an artist with a passion for both digital design and traditional artistry, I've discovered that these pursuits not only enrich my personal life but also positively impact my professional endeavors.

In the world of 3D printing, I find endless opportunities to explore innovative solutions and unleash my imagination. Each project is a canvas for creativity, where I blend technical precision with artistic flair to bring ideas to life. As I navigate the complexities of design and manufacturing, I'm constantly honing my problem-solving skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Similarly, my love for painting allows me to tap into a different aspect of my creativity. With each brushstroke, I channel emotion and expression onto the canvas, creating pieces that resonate with depth and meaning. This hands-on approach to artistry not only serves as a source of personal fulfillment but also enhances my ability to think outside the box and approach challenges with a fresh perspective in my professional life.

What truly excites me is the synergy between these two passions. As a hobbyist, I seamlessly integrate 3D printing with painting, combining digital design with traditional craftsmanship to produce unique and captivating works of art. This cross-disciplinary approach not only fuels my creative drive but also fosters innovation and originality in my work.

Beyond the studio, the skills and mindset cultivated through my artistic pursuits have a direct impact on my career. Whether it's problem-solving, adaptability, or attention to detail, the lessons learned from 3D printing and painting translate seamlessly into my professional endeavors. They serve as a reminder that creativity knows no bounds and that embracing the creative process can lead to meaningful breakthroughs in any field.

In the end, my passion for 3D printing and painting isn't just a hobby—it's a catalyst for personal and professional growth. By infusing my work with creativity and imagination, I'm able to approach challenges with a sense of optimism and innovation, driving success and fulfillment in both my artistic pursuits and my career aspirations.

## 3. Take occasional social media purges

It’s no secret that social media messes with the reward circuitry in your brain. One of the best ways to see just how it works is to take a social media purge where you commit to not using it for a certain amount of time. I’ve been surprised at how reflexively I reach for my phone and even more surprised at the free time and mental clarity I have after a couple days of adjusting.

In the past I’ve experimented with social media detoxes ranging from days to weeks and have found that the best strategy to avoid the temptation is to just delete the apps and not re-download until your purge is over. Most of the time you have an urge to check something, it’s simply a reflex and you won’t follow through since downloading the app again will take time and you will have caught yourself by then.

Another strategy, courtesy of Kenton Prescott is to enact a recurring purge, where you keep your phone in airplane mode (or even Do Not Disturb) for some amount of hours a day, limiting the time you spend catching up on notifications. The idea is that everyone can wait a few hours for your attention, even in the case of emergencies.

## 4. Turn off notifications for non-essential things

This one is pretty simple, just turn off notifications for things that are not essential. Every time your phone or wearable buzzes, you’re losing precious mental bandwidth which can take up to 23 minutes to get back!

In similar fashion to the previous steps, this takes some time and conscious effort daily where you take note of all notifications you get, evaluate if each one is worth the time, and turn off as necessary.

## 5. Learn how to use built in tools

One of my favorite features on my phone is Do Not Disturb. It allows you to silence all non-critical notifications for an indefinite amount of time. This is what I use when I’m working on school work, personal projects, or even this article. On both iOS and Android, you’re given fairly granular control over what is considered critical so you can pick and choose what is worth the focus lost from a distraction.

Apple and Google also fairly recently rolled out time management tools which allow the user to be restricted from certain applications after a given amount of use. This really helps to add an extra layer of discipline if you’re trying to build the habit of using your phone less.

Minimalism isn’t a philosophy that demands you to sell everything you own, wear the same outfit for the rest of your life, and live out of your van. Rather, it’s taking a hard look at everything in your life and determining whether something truly provides happiness for you. Digital Minimalism is a subset of this way of thinking and is a philosophy that has allowed me to work in tech and be an active participant of social media, but also maintain my own level of free thinking and choose what I focus on.

I hope this has helped at least one person out there better manage their digital engagement. When I was first starting my foray into this way of thinking, this documentary by Matt D'Avella really helped me understand what minimalism was all about and is something I’d recommend if you’d like to learn more!
