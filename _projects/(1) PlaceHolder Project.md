# The Journey

My journey began with a deep-seated admiration for the insights of Sigmund Freud and the allure of crafting dreamlike experiences. Despite facing tight deadlines—a mere four months for creation and another month for setup—I stand by the assertion that our venture into virtual simulations was a resounding success, capturing the imaginations of countless users and audiences and shedding light on the promising trajectory of virtual technology for societal progress.

In my final year, I advocated for access to a VR toolkit to kickstart my project. Drawing on years of experience, I had cultivated proficiency in coding, scene design in Unity, and asset creation using Maya and Mudbox. Though initially envisioning a Unity 3D game for my senior exhibition, I opted for a more challenging path. Embracing the opportunity to delve into VR, the journey proved immensely rewarding on a personal and professional level.

# The Outcome:

With invaluable guidance from mentors, we brought to life three distinct virtual simulations, enhanced by meticulously crafted audio compositions. Our showcase featured a spacious venue outfitted with three projectors, strategically positioned to offer varied perspectives—including that of the participants—culminating in an immersive and engaging experience for all.
