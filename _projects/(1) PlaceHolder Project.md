description: A series of virtual simulations that utilize the concepts and techniques I managed to accumlate in college. Sigmund Freud was an inspiration and the concept of dreamlike realities. While I was limited to 4 months for creation and 1 month for setup, I beleive that the virtual simulations were a success and caught many user and audience attention for the capability of virtual technology and its evolution for society.

# How I started
On my senior year,I requested a VR toolkit in order to start my project. My prior years, I learned how to code and create scenes in Unity and assets in Maya and Mudbox. At first, my senior exhibition was going to be a unity 3d game but I wanted to do something more challenging. So I took this opportunity to learn VR and the process was very rewarding.

**The Results**
I ended up with great advice from my advisors creating 3 virtual simulations with audio I created in a mixer program in the sound studio. I ended up getting a big room with 3 projectors setup to see the game at 3 different angles including the users.
