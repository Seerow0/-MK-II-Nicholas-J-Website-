# The Journey

My journey began with a admiration for the insights of Sigmund Freud and the appeal of crafting dreamlike experiences. Despite facing tight deadlines— four months for creation and another month for setup—I stand by the fact that my venture into virtual reality was a success, capturing the imaginations of users and audiences. As a result, shedding light on the promising trajectory of virtual technology.

In my final semester of college, I advocated for access to a VR toolkit to kickstart my project. Drawing on years of experience, I had cultivated proficiency in coding, Unity 3D, and asset creation using Maya, Mudbox, and Blender. Although, I initially envisioned a small Unity 3D Project for my senior exhibition, I opted for a more challenging path. Embracing the opportunity to delve into VR, the journey proved immensely rewarding on both a personal and professional level. 

# The Results

I recieved invaluable guidance from my professors and a strict deadline, we brought to life three distinct virtual simulations, enhanced by meticulously crafted audio compositions. Our showcase featured a spacious venue outfitted with three projectors, strategically positioned to offer varied perspectives—including that of the participants—culminating in an immersive and engaging experience for all. Please see below for a visual demonstration of the project.

# What Would I Have Done Differently?
Throughout the years I have thought about this project and to be perfectly candid, if I could change anything, I would choose quality over quantity. I was ambitious and wanted to create variety for the audience when I should have been focused on making one refined experience. I think of the three simulations created, only two I could say I was proud of. The last project(not shown above in the videos) in my opinion was a disaster at best with limited functionality. It really was just a testing ground to see what I could accomplish in a short amount of time. When it comes down to it, time and inexperience (coding for VR) was my worst enemy. I could have had one longer simulation with more refined gameplay and interaction, however, I felt that would have been unwise for the audience/players at the time. By keeping them shorter, and offering variety, there was something for everyone. 

# What Lies Ahead?
As an artist, I find solace in the limitless realm of conceptual art, where experimentation and creative inquiry are pushed beyond thier limits. While the future remains a mystery, I'm deeply intrigued by the landscape of virtual reality and its rapidly evolving usage across industries. While I can't predict what lies ahead, I'm committed to staying informed and exploring the potential of VR as a medium for artistic expression. In this ever-changing landscape, I see endless opportunities to push the boundaries of my craft and immerse myself in new realms of creativity, wherever the journey may lead.

# The Most Recent Project (2021)
**The video below shows the last project I worked on in 2021**
- With limited access to VR space and focuses on other projects, I have taken a break from Unity3D but I am excited for when I do return.
