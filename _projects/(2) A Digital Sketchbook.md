## Introduction
Art is a playground where boundaries are pushed, where concepts take shape, and where mistakes are celebrated as valuable lessons. I want to improve my understanding and I will continue to make the effort. It is important take note of your progress. I constantly challenge myself and attempt to be happy with every small improvement. By completing small goals, you essentially are creating a roadmap of the person you are and could be. There is a difference in what you want and what you will do. I look forward to these challenges as I continue my journey as an artist and technology enthusiast.

# What Comes Next
It is important to document work because in time you can see the progress you have made and reflect back on your growth. Therefore while I continue my career, I will document and update this site as needed.
