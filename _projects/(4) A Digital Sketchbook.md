## Introduction
Art is a playground where boundaries are pushed, where concepts take shape, and where mistakes are celebrated as valuable lessons in disguise. I want to improve my understanding and I will make the effort. It will be a road that I will traverse depsite any obstacles that may come my way. It is difficult to show work without opening yourself to criticisms. It is important note your progress. In a book I am reading, it mentions that setting large goals are ineffective because we make it into the the holy grail. Once we obtain it, we expect to feel  empowered, but the reality is often disappointing and before you know it there is another goal around the corner. Therefore it is important that I need to constantly challenge myself and be satisfied with every small improvement. By turning small goals into habbits, you essentially are creating an identity of the person you will be. There is a difference in what you want and what you will do. I look forward to these challenges as I continue my journey.

# What Comes Next
It is important to document work because in time you can see the progress you have made and reflect back on your growth. Therefore while I continue my career, I will document and update this site as needed.
