# â€ŽIntro
Beyond drawings, this sketchbook is a testament to exploration and experimentation. It's a playground where boundaries are pushed, where concepts take shape, and where mistakes are celebrated as valuable lessons in disguise. (Or something like that...)

# Somewhere In The Middle

 I am constantly challenging myself to explore new techniques, styles, and ideas. I am still learning and hope to surpass my expectations. It is important to understand and learn as an artist because insight is invaluable. We transfer what we see and what we cannot see using mediums as an interface.

# What Comes Next
I will try to keep my site updated as much as I can. I think it is important to document work because in time you can see the progress you have made and reflect back on your growth.
