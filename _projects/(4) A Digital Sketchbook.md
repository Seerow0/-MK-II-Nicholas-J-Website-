# What is design?
 To be completely honest, I am still exploring the definition of design. Design is an important fundamental contribution to a functioning society. We get our infrastructure, our signage, and so much more from design. I would say design is equivalent to the role of inventor in which they both inspire innovation.

I will post my work here, a mixture of the bad and the good and the mediocre.
