# The Journey

My journey began with a deep-seated admiration for the insights of Sigmund Freud and the allure of crafting dreamlike experiences. Despite facing tight deadlines— four months for creation and another month for setup—I stand by the fact that our venture into virtual simulations was a success, capturing the imaginations of countless users and audiences and shedding light on the promising trajectory of virtual technology.

In my final year of college, I advocated for access to a VR toolkit to kickstart my project. Drawing on years of experience, I had cultivated proficiency in coding, Unity 3D, and asset creation using Maya and Mudbox, and Blender. Although, I initially envisioned a simple Unity 3D game for my senior exhibition, I opted for a more challenging path. Embracing the opportunity to delve into VR, the journey proved immensely rewarding on a personal and professional level.

# The Outcome:

With invaluable guidance from mentors, we brought to life three distinct virtual simulations, enhanced by meticulously crafted audio compositions. Our showcase featured a spacious venue outfitted with three projectors, strategically positioned to offer varied perspectives—including that of the participants—culminating in an immersive and engaging experience for all. Please see below for a visual understanding of the project.

# The future
As an artist, I find solace in the limitless realm of concept art, where experimentation and creative inquiry are pushed beyond thier limits. While the future remains a mystery waiting to unfold, I'm deeply intrigued by the landscape of virtual reality and its rapidly evolving usage across industries. While I can't predict what lies ahead, I'm committed to staying informed and exploring the potential of VR as a medium for artistic expression. In this ever-changing landscape, I see endless opportunities to push the boundaries of my craft and immerse myself in new realms of creativity, wherever the journey may lead.
